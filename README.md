# RookieML

### What is RookieML?

Rookie ML is a collection of Jupyter notebooks for people who have little or no experience with machine learning or its allied areas. I've attempted to explain complex machine learning concepts using simple, real life situations and examples. I've included code snippets in Python, so readers can take a look at the implementation too.

The primary purpose of RookieML is to introduce beginners to various machine learning concepts and applications, without intimidating them with any mathe-magical stuff.
